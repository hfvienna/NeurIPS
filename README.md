Hi,
Setup and onboarding with toy submission was great, thank you for that.
We will initially follow this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g68qlo9Izf0 and see how far we get tomorrow.
As Attila and I are currently not employed in any company with access to GPUs we would love the AWS credits.

Best,
Hannes
