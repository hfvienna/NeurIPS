## Update:20230918 afternoon

Hi,
Setup and onboarding with toy submission was great, thank you for that.
We will try via the following approaches:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g68qlo9Izf0
2. https://blog.langchain.dev/using-langsmith-to-support-fine-tuning-of-open-source-llms/
3. https://learn.deeplearning.ai/finetuning-large-language-models/lesson/2/why-finetune

and then see how far we get with that tomorrow.
As Attila and I are currently not employed in any company with access to GPUs we would love the AWS credits.

Best,
Hannes

PS: Don't get thrown off by our repository name, it is a reference to "Odysseus nobody". ;
